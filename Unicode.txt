Unicode n'est pas seulement un mapping de character. Il permet aussi de spécifier quel est le type de ceux-ci.

«
On its surface, Unicode is a mapping (like ASCII), but the Unicode Standard offers much more. 
It also defines qualities about each character, such as:

"this character is a lowercase letter", 
"this character is meant to be written right-to-left", 
"this character is a mark that's meant to be combined with another character", 
etc.
